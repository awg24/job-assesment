# job-assesment

This was made with react and backbone.

Make sure to npm install to get all dependancies.

When everything is installed, type in "gulp serve" in the command line to start up localhost and run the site,
else cookies will be disabled by default and you won't be able login. 

Blog posts are not persistent as there's no backend, so if you login as an admin you'll be able to populate the 
blog.
